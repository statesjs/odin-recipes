    <h3>Beef au la Childhood</h3>
    <p>One of the all time favorite meals growing up in a korean restaurant. The sweetness of 
        the beef mixed <br>with the refreshing taste on scallions makes for the perfect meal anytime
        of the day.
    </p>

    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Beef</li>
        <li>Green Onions</li>
        <li>Soy Sauce</li>
        <li>Sugar</li>
        <li>Sesame Seeds</li>
        <li>Sesame Oil</li>
        <li>Pepper</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Recipe</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Place the flank steak in a shallow bowl. In a separate bowl, combine the rest
             of the ingredients and whisk until blended. Pour the marinade over the steak
              â€” make sure the meat is completely covered. 
            Cover the bowl and allow the beef to marinate in the fridge for about an hour.  </li>
        <li>On a lightly oiled grill set to high heat, cook the beef until it's charred and completely cooked through. 
            This should take about 1 or 2 minutes on each side. </li>
        <li> Finally season with fresh cut green onions for a more crisp taste and smell.</li>
    </ol>
